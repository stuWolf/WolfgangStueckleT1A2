    <h1>Development of a new ECM function package from customer specification</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>In the last decade, the engine management software developed to a fairly complex system consisting of more than 
      450 functions directly involved in the engine management itself plus another couple of hundred functions on the driver
       and BIOS layer. This results in a total of about half a million lines of C- code. This is far more than the computer
        programme of the space shuttle consisted of. It takes a building full of engineers to maintain and develop a system of this
         size. 
      This complexity is handled by a strict definition of module interfaces and processes how a new software 
      module has to be developed, tested and released. (please see figure 1) Currently, a team of over a hundred software engineers are
       dealing with the latest generation engine management software internal called ME9 (Motronic Electronic throttle), 
       spread in workgroups and each workgroup deals with one specific function group.  For example, one workgroup develops the
        knock control functions for all customers and another one is responsible for the driver and BIOS layer and so on. This kind 
        of work split is certainly the key to handle such a complex system. The disadvantages are however that the development time 
        from specification to release to the customer often takes unacceptably long and the effort for communication between the 
        workgroups is considerable.
