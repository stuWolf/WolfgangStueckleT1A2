      Very true, so many victories in life start with adequate sleep and exercise. I want to add as an increase perseverance and focus during the day. Just my experience during the last year of study.

      Then there are the so-called story stocks, whose valuation is based on products in development and expected future profits. Typically, the businesses behind them are start-ups which donâ€™t have any profit or revenue yet. During times of rising interest rates, they tend to get sold off because of their dependence on cheap money. Also, higher debt costs will reduce projected profits.

      We have seen how this has played out very well this year. Start ups and junior miners sold off sharply. However thanks to the boom in AI triggered by Chat GPT the NASDAQ is leaving the Dow Jones way behind this year. The big tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple use their vast resources to adopt this new trend quickly. NVIDIA is making the GPUs (graphic processing units) which are an integral part of the hardware fuelling the large language models like OpenAI/Chat GPT and Google/Barth. NVIDIA Up 113% the last 12 month.

    <p>With amniotic eggs showing up roughly 340 million or so years ago, and the first chickens evolving at around 58 thousand years ago at the earliest, it's a safe bet to say the egg came first. Eggs were around way before chickens even existed

    <p> 
      Sooner or later, Alexa, Google, or Siri will reach self-awareness and start running the world. I am thinking about a whole new form of intelligence here, and it will start manipulating everything: the markets, commodity prices, what information is displayed in the media, in short, every aspect of our lives controlled by the internet. And we will not realize it until it's too late because most of us stopped using our brains long ago due to the ever-growing AI support we get for everything we do.

      Reflecting on the period since writing this text, one cannot help but acknowledge the significant impact of the emergence of Chat GPT. While initially meant to be humorous, it has become clear that this new system has transformed the way we view artificial intelligence, raising questions about the potential for super intelligent or even self-aware systems in the near future. This development represents a major shift in our industry, and it is crucial that we embrace the opportunities presented by this new technology and make a concerted effort to deepen our understanding of it.
