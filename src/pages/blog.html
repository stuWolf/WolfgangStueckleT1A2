    <h1 class="title">What are the different types of stocks? </h1>
    <p>
      There are the so called value stocks which value is determined by metrics like PE (share price to earnings) ratio profit and dividend history, product pipeline. Then there are the so called story stocks, there valuation is based on products in development and expected future profits. Typically the businesses behind them are start-ups which donâ€™t have any profit or revenue yet. 
During times of rising interest rates they tend to get sold off because of their dependence on cheap money. Also higher debt costs will reduce projected profits.

    <h1 class="title">What was first, the chicken or the egg? </h1>
    <p>With amniotic eggs showing up roughly 340 million or so years ago, and the first chickens evolving at around 58 thousand years ago at the earliest, it's a safe bet to say the egg came first. Eggs were around way before chickens even existed

    <h1 class="title">What is my prediction for the future? </h1>
    <p> I beleave thatSooner or later Alexa, Google or Siri will reach self-awareness and start running the world. I am thinking about a whole new form of intelligence here and it will start manipulating everything: the markets, commodity prices, what information is displayed in the media, in short every aspect of our lives controlled by the internet. And we will not realise until it is too late because most of us stopped using our brains long ago because of the ever growing AI support we get for everything we do.
