    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <p>
           
    </p>
    <p >
      I believe what sets me apart as a developer is my diverse background and unique experiences. I've had the opportunity to work in both software development and electrical engineering, which gives me a comprehensive understanding of technology from multiple angles. This could be particularly useful when working on projects that require a blend of these skills, like embedded systems or IoT.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've also been fortunate to work internationally, in Germany and Australia, with a renowned company like Robert Bosch. This experience has broadened my perspective and helped me understand how technology is used and developed in different parts of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a business owner at Wolf Electrical, I've had the chance to lead teams and manage projects, which has given me a deeper understanding of the business aspects of technology. I've also had hands-on experience with solar PV systems and training apprentices, which has enriched my practical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I'm committed to continuous learning. I've pursued a Nanodegree in C/C++ from Udacity and a Higher Education Diploma in Information Technology to stay updated with the latest technologies. I believe this commitment to learning is crucial in the fast-paced tech sector.

    </p>
   
 
     
    <p>
    As a next venture, I would like to learn more about machine learning/AI and refresh my skills in embedded software development. I am also interested in trading and the stock market and keen to learn more about that too.
    </p> 
   
<p>
For above reasons I am confident I could contribute significantly to your organisation. If you are interested please feel free to download my resume.
