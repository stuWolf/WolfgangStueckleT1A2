    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <p>
           
    </p>
    <p >
    For the past 11 years, I have run my own business as an electrician and solar installer. In this role, I have convinced many customers of the necessity to reduce their carbon footprint, transition to all-electric solutions, and install solar PV systems. I have installed about 1MW worth of domestic and commercial solar, led and trained five apprentices to be ready for their exams to become A-grade electricians, and completed many major electrical projects.

    Before that, I worked as a software integrator and project manager, specializing in hardware-near software (in C and assembler), for a multinational company in the automotive industry. This experience gave me a broad perspective on working in a large organization and multinational environment. My projects have taken me to many countries: Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and even Japan in my first job. All these experiences have made me well-traveled and knowledgeable, and I am confident I could contribute significantly to any organization.

    Given the current labor shortage in the IT industry, I found it a great opportunity to refresh my skills in this field and learn the latest innovations in software development. I enrolled in a course at Coder Academy because it seemed to me a premier place to study IT and learn a wide variety of state-of-the-art tools and programming languages in a short amount of time. I believe the course's focus on web and database design is a great addition to my existing tech stack in hardware-near software. I also completed a diploma in C/C++ at Udacity to refresh and enhance my skills in these languages.

    As a next step, I would like to learn more about machine learning/AI and embedded software. I am also interested in trading and the stock market and keen to learn more about that too.
