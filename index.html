    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website. Grown up in Switzerland my name is Wolfgang Stueckle and I am interested in everything science and technology.

      <p>
        The last 10 years I operated my own business as electrician and solar installer, where I convinced many customers of the necessity to reduce our carbon footprint, go all electric and install solar. Before that I worked as software integrator and programmer in hardware near software (mostly in C) for a multinational company in the automotive industry.  
      Because of the current labor shortage in the IT industry I beleave it is the perfect opportunity to go back to my old skills and get into programming again. I choose this course at Coder Academy because it was advertised to me as the go to place to study IT and the support to find work later. Also it covers a broad variety of state of the art tools and programming languages what is a good addition to my tech stack. Apart from that being able to place content on the internet is always a nifty skill to have because in the end the internet is the bush drum of the 21st century.
       I am also currently working at a diploma in C/C++ at Udacity to brush up my skills there.
